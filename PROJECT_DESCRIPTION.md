# Food Delivery Application - Project Description

## 5 Professional Resume Points (Recommended):

1. **Architected Full-Stack Food Delivery Platform**
   - Engineered a scalable MERN stack application (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) with RESTful API architecture, implementing Context API for global state management and responsive design principles for optimal cross-device user experience.

2. **Implemented Secure Authentication & Authorization**
   - Developed enterprise-grade authentication system using JWT tokens and bcrypt hashing algorithms, implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure user sessions and protected API endpoints for multi-user workflows.

3. **Built Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**
   - Designed and developed an intuitive admin interface with full CRUD capabilities for inventory management, real-time order tracking system, and dynamic image upload functionality using Multer middleware, streamlining business operations and order fulfillment.

4. **Developed E-Commerce Cart & Order Management**
   - Created persistent shopping cart system with MongoDB integration, implemented seamless order processing workflow with multiple payment gateway support (Stripe), and built comprehensive order history tracking for enhanced user experience and business analytics.

5. **Designed Scalable RESTful API Architecture**
   - Architected robust RESTful APIs following industry best practices, implementing CORS policies, custom middleware for request validation, comprehensive error handling, and optimized database queries using Mongoose ODM for efficient data operations.
